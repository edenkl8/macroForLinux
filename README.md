# macroForLinux

this code is intended to create macros in linux.

this code uses the pynput library:
https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pynput


the pynput library is used for mouse/keyboard input and output


# usage:
to start the program just run it:

">> python macro.py"

the default macro trigger is ctrl+k+b(in this order)

and the default macro writing is "hello"

# TO-DO:
1) in next versions I will add support for multiple macros

2) in next versions I will add support for determining the mcros outside of the code

3) in next versions I will ad a gui
